Charity Project
Overview
The Charity Project is a mini web application landing page designed for a charity organization. It showcases a responsive design with a navigation bar, a banner, sections for about the charity, volunteer highlights, services, and a call-to-action for donations. This project was developed as a practical mini class project during a web development course to apply HTML and CSS skills, focusing on layout design, responsiveness, and user interface creation.
This was a mini class project completed while learning fundamental web development concepts such as HTML structure, CSS styling, Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsive design.
